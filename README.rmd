## Equity Market Monitor

### Inspiration
This represents my first attempt at creating a shiny app and draws inspiration from two main sources. 

First, RStudio's RViews blog has a series entitled "Reproducible Finance with R" that is quite excellent. Jonathan Regenstein is the primary author in the series and recently published a piece on [ETF correlations](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/2017/01/18/reproducible-finance-with-r-sector-correlations/). Second, Business Science (a small, business/finance-oriented software development firm) picked up on the RViews post and [recreated it](http://www.business-science.io/financial-analysis/2017/02/02/Recreating-RViews-Reproducible-Finance-Post.html) using tidyquant, their own internally-developed R package. 

What RViews lacked in simplicity, Business Science more than made up for, but without the interactivity peice so I decided to borrow from both examples and create the best of both worlds--with a few personal touches.

### Results
The end result is the code behind this [shiny app](jtryker.shinyapps.io/market_monitor). On the 'Market Performance' tab, a user can specify a window of time to see recent stock market performance as well as volatility. A simple moving-average line is also shown with these charts to help contextualize recent events relative to the past. The 'Sector Correlations' tab contains the meat of what RViews and Business Science were focused on, except that here I have allowed a user to specify any two ETFs to compare (via a dropdown). I also built in functionality for a user to change several other relevant elements for robustness.

There are almost endless possibilities for new functionality in an app like this and I look forward to adding new features in the future. For now, enjoy!

### Notes on methodology
Price data is obtained via Yahoo finance and returns are calculated as simple holding period returns over the period the user specifies (monthly, weekly, daily). The information presented on the Market Performance tab represents true index level performance for the S&P 500 and CBOE Volatility indices (tickers ^GSPC & ^VIX). The information presented on the Sector correlations tab represents information on SPDR sector ETFs.
